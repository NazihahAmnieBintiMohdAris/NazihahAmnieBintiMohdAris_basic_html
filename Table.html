  <li>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry</li></p>
  <li>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s.

  
 <br><br>

2. Where does it come from?
<br></p>
 
  <li>Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</li></p>
  
  <li> Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.</li>

  <td>Item 2</td> <td> 3. Why do we use it?
  
  <ol class="n">
  i.The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.<br></p>
  ii.Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. <br></p>
  iii.Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
